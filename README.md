# Front-end-Compiler
 Note - The Bison and Flex tools are necessary in order to run the .lex file, so that you can compile and generate your own executables.

 A front-end compiler, composed of a lexical analyzer, parser, and a code generator. This analyzer utilizes a high-level language, called MINI-L, to parse input and solves equations if syntactically correct. 

 The program warns you of the line and location of an syntax error in the input if it encounters anything unexpected/incorrect.

 A makefile is included for easier use of the bison and flex tools, or can serve as a reference for the correct method to utilize Bison and Flex commands.
